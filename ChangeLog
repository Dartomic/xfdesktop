	properly set the number of desktops at startup...

	* settings/: Makefile.am, Makefile.in, debug.h: Add debug.h. It's
	silly to depend on version insalled by xfce4-panel.

	* ChangeLog: Update ChangeLog

2003-01-18 14:51  xfce

	* src/: backdrop.c, main.c: * Remove double buffering in desktop
	window otherwise gtk allocates twice the size of the screen in
	video memory which can show to be unusable even on a GeForce II MX
	with 32Mb using 3D because the video RAM alloted to pixmaps cannot
	handle the total amount of pixmaps.  * Reduce scale quality to
	BILINEAR instead of HYPER because it takes too long even on a PIV
	1.7GHz scalling from 1024x768 to 1280x768
