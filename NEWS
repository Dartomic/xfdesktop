4.5.99.1
========
- Remove the menu editor (which was just a stub anyway).


Xfce 4.5.93
===========
- Avoid an infinite loop if all files in a backdrop list are invalid.


4.5.92
======
- Display 'Audio' and 'Video' categories in the multimedia submenu.
- Fix multiple image selection in settings dialog file chooser (bug 4522).
- Always use the XfceMenuElement interface for reading the display names
  of menu items and menus. This ensures that items appear sorted in
  alphabetic order.


4.5.91
======
- Bring back the "show icons in menu" preferences for the desktop
  menu and window list menu.
- Add support for XDG user dirs for the Desktop and Templates
  directories.  Patch from Andrea Santilli <yawara@quipo.it> (bug 4365).
- Fix xfdesktop/xfce menu crashing when installing new applications that
  install .desktop files and icons (bug 3615).
- Fix occasional "double menu" after menu/icon files change on disk
  (bug 4342).
- Implement "rubber banding" for the desktop icon view (bug 3245).
- Honor the Hidden=, OnlyShowIn=, and NeverShowIn= keys in .desktop
  files in the desktop folder (bug 4022).
- Fix window menu popping up even after last window icon was
  de-selected when using minimized app icons.
- Display 'Eject' in the context menu for removable drives that
  support eject, not just optical discs (bug 3738).
- Fix memory leak (not freeing result of gtk_container_get_children()
  in the desktop menu code).
- Fix memory/X window leak (not destroying menu in panel plugin after
  it's closed; old menu didn't require it, but new one does).
- Use GtkFileChooserButtons in the panel plugin config dialog instead
  of entry box + button, and remove the 'Edit menu' button/menu item
  since we don't have a menu editor anymore.
- Add cell-spacing, cell-padding, and cell-text-width-proportion
  stlye properties to XfdesktopIconView to control spacing/sizing of
  the icon grid (bug 2886).  Patch from Giacomo Lozito.
- Add the ellipsize-icon-labels style property  to control whether
  or not unselected icons get their labels truncated (bug 2886).
  Patch from Daniel Gibson.
- Add style properties to enable painting a text shadow 'under' the
  desktop icon text labels (bug 4412).  Patch from Andrea Santilli.
- Add backdrop image preview to settings dialog.
- Make settings dialog pluggable into the Xfce Settings Manager.
- Make the Help button in the settings dialog do something.


4.5.90
======
- Redo how the menu system works so menus can be embedded in other
  menus.  This makes it possible for the right-click context menu
  to be the 'normal' applications menu when icons are disabled,
  but set to the desktop's own context menu when file icons are
  enabled.  In this latter case, the applications menu becomes a
  submenu of the desktop context menu (bug 2531).
- Ditch my custom semi-fd.o-compliant menu system in favor of
  XfceMenu, our new fd.o-compliant menu implementation written by
  Jannis Pohlmann.
- Fix URI parsing in .desktop files when launching an application so
  that the "field codes" (%-codes) are either properly ignored or
  are substituted properly.  This should fix a lot of problems where
  some apps were expecting some command-line arguments but the menu
  was just throwing them all away (bug 2942).
- Add support for 'zoomed' backdrop mode: fill the screen with the
  backdrop edge-to-edge by scaling and/or cropping as necessary.
  This doesn't mess with the aspect ratio and is pretty nifty.  Patch
  is from <trondsg@gmail.com> (bug 3138).
- Stop using our forked libnetk from libxfcegui4, and use the much
  better supported original libwnck.  Patch is from Nick Schermer
  (bug 3487).
- Support the GdkScreen::monitors-changed signal present in gtk+ 2.13
  and above.  This allows xfdesktop to notice if the user plugs or
  unplugs a monitor when using an xrandr1.2-capable X server and video
  driver.
- Support the new tooltips framework present in gtk 2.12 for
  XfdesktopIconView.  This is mostly user-invisible, but does decrease
  code size and memory usage ever so slightly, and removes a possible
  source of bugs.
- Remove all old MCS settings manager code and start using Xfconf,
  Xfce's new configuration system.
- New redesigned settings dialog, with hopefully some better usability.
- Move hidden options for showing special icons on the desktop into
  the settings dialog GUI.
- Add a color saturation adjustment to the backdrop image settings.
- Add "transparent" color style for the backdrop; if you already have
  another application drawing the backdrop, you can disable xfdesktop's
  image drawing and color drawing and "see through" to the window
  beneath it while still having desktop icons and the desktop menu
  available.  Requires ARGB windows (bug 4061).
- Fix font size used to draw desktop icons when the size isn't an
  integer point size (bug 4295).


4.4.2
=====
- Fix menu sometimes not popping up when using the keyboard shortcut,
  again.  Timeout waiting for grab is now 0.25s (bug 441).
- Fix desktop settings only getting applied to the first screen in
  non-Xinerama dualhead setups (but 3467).
- Fix spurious drag when double-clicking a volume icon that fails to
  mount (bug 3426).
- Clean out stale entries in file icon position file (bug 3267).
- Some minor memory leak fixes (some still remain, likely).
- Fix ==disable-menu-editor configure option.
- Always use button 0 in gtk_menu_popup() as GTK+ 2.11+ expects the
  same button to be pressed or it doesn't activate the entry (bug 3359).
- Don't set workspace for sticky windows in windowlist (bug 3317).
- Fix missing xfce_rc_close() causing memleak and too many open file
  descriptors (bug 3065).
- Fix the Italian xfdesktop menu causing a crash.


4.4.1
=====
- Fix entries in the menu.xml files that should not have been translated.
- Add support for menu file as argument (Bug #2876).
- Remove use of __FUNCTION__ as it breaks sun's compiler (Bug #2924).
- Blurry rendering of unscaled backgrounds (Bug #2939).
- Fix uri parsing to unescape '%##' stuff in the uri (Bug #2942).
- Many translation updates.

many changes since my last entry.

4.4beta1
========
As usual, it's been a while since I've written anything.  The major new
accomplishment since my last entry is that all the desktop icon code
has been refactored, and now, in addition to CDEish minimised application
icons, xfdesktop supports traditional desktop file icons.  This
functionality requires very recent versions of libexo and thunar-vfs to
be present and installed before compiling xfdesktop.

Olivier and Benny just put together the 4.4beta1 release over the weekend,
so we're (finally!) gearing up to release 4.4.0 final within the next 4-6
weeks (hopefully).

(Brian)


20051031
========
Happy Halloween.   haven't wrote anything here in quite a while.
Quite a bit has happened, including numerous bugfixes and enhancements.
I don't have the energy to list them all here, but the one thing that
really sticks out is that xfdesktop now supports icons on the desktop.
No, it's not what you think: you can't put launcher icons on it, and
you can't view lists of files either.  What you *can* do is see icons
representing all your minimized applications, a la CDE.  Other
projects (xffm, Thunar) will address the need for file and launcher
icons.

The Xfce menu panel plugin has seen several improvements, including
some menu generation speed enhancements, and the ability to put a
text title in the button, as well as using non-square icons.

On the bugfix front, notably, you can bind 'xfdesktop -menu' and
'xfdesktop -windowlist' to keys now, and it should work properly all
the time.

There are a few small enhancements to the backdrop functionality,
such as the ability to stretch a single image across a Xinerama-
enabled desktop.

I suppose that's all for now.  Development of Xfce as a whole has been
moving somewhat slowly lately, so 4.4.0 may not be coming as soon as
we'd like.

(Brian)


Xfce 4.2rc3
===========
Xfdesktop is shaping up quite well for the 4.2.0 release, but there
were a few necessary bugfixes:

- Redo the backdrop setting method to fix redraw problems with
  Gtk 2.6, and to make it a bit nicer to maintain.
- Fix a backdrop drawing problem that crops up if you're using
  multihead and a gtk2 theme with a background pixmap.
- The desktop menu cache now tracks changes to the XDG_DATA_DIRS
  environment variable and invalidates the cache if it changes.
- Jean-Francois did some stuff with menueditor, but I think it
  was just some code reorg and optimisation.
- Added back the add/remove workspace items to the windowlist
  menu because Francois asked oh-so-nicely.

Hopefully this should be it, and xfdesktop won't need any more changes
for 4.2.0-final.  Of course, now that I said it, it's ruined.

(Brian)


Xfce 4.2rc2
===========
Not much has happened with xfdesktop in the last month, mainly some
minorish bugfixes:

- Fix problem with panel plugin where the button can sometimes
  stay "pressed in" if the menu isn't available.
- Documentation updates (Jasper, mostly)
- Tweak menu directory searching.
- Filter desktop files based on desktop-id to avoid duplicate
  menu entries.
- Fix bug where sticky windows weren't shown in the window list
  at all.
- Fix menu module not loading at all on some systems when the
  quit() symbol can't be resolved.
- Fix problem where window titles with GMarkup in them weren't
  being escaped properly.
- Remove an occurrence of xfce_get_userfile() (replace with
  xfce_resource_lookup()).
- Remove workspace add/remove, as that doesn't work properly
  anymore, and it probably shouldn't be there anyway.

(Brian)


Xfce 4.2beta2
=============
Wow, it's been a while since anyone's put anything in here.  We're
gearing up for the release of 4.2beta2, the second beta release
on the road to 4.2.0.  A lot has happened in the last year:

- Partial rewrite and redesign to support multihead setups (with
  or without Xinerama).
- Better support for handling screen size changes via the XRandR
  extension.
- A new autogenerated menu that searches for .desktop files on
  your filesystem and organises them into hierarchical menus.
- Icon support for the applications menu and window list menu
- Backdrop color gradient support.
- Ability to adjust the brightness of the backdrop image.
- Jean-Francois Wauthy wrote a graphical menu editor, which is
  distributed with xfdesktop.
- A panel plugin that can display the menu from xfce4-panel.
- An enhanced and partially redesigned settings window, with
  some global menu settings added.

(Brian)


20031019
========
- Add '-reload', '-menu' and '-windowlist' arguments to xfdesktop to
  make it reaload/refresh the image, popup the menu or popup the
  windowlist repectively.

(Jasper)


20031016
========
- Added support for the XRandR X extension available with XFree86
  4.3 and above. The XRandR support requires you to have Gtk+
  2.2 or better installed.

(Benny)
