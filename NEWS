20060418 (Xfce 4.4beta1):
-------------------------

    As usual, it's been a while since I've written anything.  The major new
    accomplishment since my last entry is that all the desktop icon code
    has been refactored, and now, in addition to CDEish minimised application
    icons, xfdesktop supports traditional desktop file icons.  This
    functionality requires very recent versions of libexo and thunar-vfs to
    be present and installed before compiling xfdesktop.
    
    Olivier and Benny just put together the 4.4beta1 release over the weekend,
    so we're (finally!) gearing up to release 4.4.0 final within the next 4-6
    weeks (hopefully).

    Happy Halloween.  I haven't wrote anything here in quite a while.
    Quite a bit has happened, including numerous bugfixes and enhancements.
    I don't have the energy to list them all here, but the one thing that
    really sticks out is that xfdesktop now supports icons on the desktop.
    No, it's not what you think: you can't put launcher icons on it, and
    you can't view lists of files either.  What you *can* do is see icons
    representing all your minimized applications, a la CDE.  Other
    projects (xffm, Thunar) will address the need for file and launcher
    icons.
    
    The Xfce menu panel plugin has seen several improvements, including
    some menu generation speed enhancements, and the ability to put a
    text title in the button, as well as using non-square icons.
    
    On the bugfix front, notably, you can bind 'xfdesktop -menu' and
    'xfdesktop -windowlist' to keys now, and it should work properly all
    the time.
    
    There are a few small enhancements to the backdrop functionality,
    such as the ability to stretch a single image across a Xinerama-
    enabled desktop.
    
    I suppose that's all for now.  Development of Xfce as a whole has been
    moving somewhat slowly lately, so 4.4.0 may not be coming as soon as
    we'd like.

20041220 (Xfce 4.2rc3):
-----------------------

	Xfdesktop is shaping up quite well for the 4.2.0 release, but there
	were a few necessary bugfixes:
	  - Redo the backdrop setting method to fix redraw problems with
	    Gtk 2.6, and to make it a bit nicer to maintain.
	  - Fix a backdrop drawing problem that crops up if you're using
	    multihead and a gtk2 theme with a background pixmap.
	  - The desktop menu cache now tracks changes to the XDG_DATA_DIRS
	    environment variable and invalidates the cache if it changes.
	  - Jean-Francois did some stuff with menueditor, but I think it
	    was just some code reorg and optimisation.
	  - Added back the add/remove workspace items to the windowlist
	    menu because Francois asked oh-so-nicely.

	Hopefully this should be it, and xfdesktop won't need any more changes
	for 4.2.0-final.  Of course, now that I said it, it's ruined.

20041205 (Xfce 4.2rc2):
-----------------------

	Not much has happened with xfdesktop in the last month, mainly some
	minorish bugfixes:
	  - Fix problem with panel plugin where the button can sometimes
	    stay "pressed in" if the menu isn't available.
	  - Documentation updates (Jasper, mostly)
	  - Tweak menu directory searching.
	  - Filter desktop files based on desktop-id to avoid duplicate
	    menu entries.
	  - Fix bug where sticky windows weren't shown in the window list
	    at all.
	  - Fix menu module not loading at all on some systems when the
	    quit() symbol can't be resolved.
	  - Fix problem where window titles with GMarkup in them weren't
	    being escaped properly.
	  - Remove an occurrence of xfce_get_userfile() (replace with
	    xfce_resource_lookup()).
	  - Remove workspace add/remove, as that doesn't work properly
	    anymore, and it probably shouldn't be there anyway.

20041029 (Xfce 4.2beta2):
-------------------------

	* Wow, it's been a while since anyone's put anything in here.  We're
	  gearing up for the release of 4.2beta2, the second beta release
	  on the road to 4.2.0.  A lot has happened in the last year:
	    - Partial rewrite and redesign to support multihead setups (with
	      or without Xinerama).
	    - Better support for handling screen size changes via the XRandR
	      extension.
	    - A new autogenerated menu that searches for .desktop files on
	      your filesystem and organises them into hierarchical menus.
	    - Icon support for the applications menu and window list menu
	    - Backdrop color gradient support.
	    - Ability to adjust the brightness of the backdrop image.
	    - Jean-Francois Wauthy wrote a graphical menu editor, which is
	      distributed with xfdesktop.
	    - A panel plugin that can display the menu from xfce4-panel.
	    - An enhanced and partially redesigned settings window, with
	      some global menu settings added.

20031019:
---------

	* Add '-reload', '-menu' and '-windowlist' arguments to xfdesktop to 
	  make it reaload/refresh the image, popup the menu or popup the
	  windowlist repectively.

(Jasper)


20031016:
---------

	* Added support for the XRandR X extension available with XFree86
	  4.3 and above. The XRandR support requires you to have Gtk+
	  2.2 or better installed.
