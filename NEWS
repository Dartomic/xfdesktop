4.2.0:
------

    -  Gradient support for background color.
    - Brightness adjustment for the backdrop.
    - Real multiscreen and Xinerama support.
    - Support for icons in window list and applications menu.
    - Ability to disable/enable icons in each menu, or the menus entirely.
    - Graphical menu editor with DnD support from xfce4-appfinder and .desktop
      files from Rox, Konqueror, Nautilus, Xffm, etc.
    - Add "-menu", "-windowlist" and "-reload" options for "xfdesktop", to be
      use in keybindings.
    - Support for 'system' menu, which lists all apps that install *.desktop
      files according to the Freedesktop.org Menu Spec.
    - Panel plugin to show the menu (yes, it's a Start button).
    - Use a menu cache to improve performance after it has been generated once.
    - Kiosk mode support.


20041220 (Xfce 4.2rc3):
-----------------------

	Xfdesktop is shaping up quite well for the 4.2.0 release, but there
	were a few necessary bugfixes:
	  - Redo the backdrop setting method to fix redraw problems with
	    Gtk 2.6, and to make it a bit nicer to maintain.
	  - Fix a backdrop drawing problem that crops up if you're using
	    multihead and a gtk2 theme with a background pixmap.
	  - The desktop menu cache now tracks changes to the XDG_DATA_DIRS
	    environment variable and invalidates the cache if it changes.
	  - Jean-Francois did some stuff with menueditor, but I think it
	    was just some code reorg and optimisation.
	  - Added back the add/remove workspace items to the windowlist
	    menu because Francois asked oh-so-nicely.

	Hopefully this should be it, and xfdesktop won't need any more changes
	for 4.2.0-final.  Of course, now that I said it, it's ruined.

20041205 (Xfce 4.2rc2):
-----------------------

	Not much has happened with xfdesktop in the last month, mainly some
	minorish bugfixes:
	  - Fix problem with panel plugin where the button can sometimes
	    stay "pressed in" if the menu isn't available.
	  - Documentation updates (Jasper, mostly)
	  - Tweak menu directory searching.
	  - Filter desktop files based on desktop-id to avoid duplicate
	    menu entries.
	  - Fix bug where sticky windows weren't shown in the window list
	    at all.
	  - Fix menu module not loading at all on some systems when the
	    quit() symbol can't be resolved.
	  - Fix problem where window titles with GMarkup in them weren't
	    being escaped properly.
	  - Remove an occurrence of xfce_get_userfile() (replace with
	    xfce_resource_lookup()).
	  - Remove workspace add/remove, as that doesn't work properly
	    anymore, and it probably shouldn't be there anyway.

20041029 (Xfce 4.2beta2):
---------

	* Wow, it's been a while since anyone's put anything in here.  We're
	  gearing up for the release of 4.2beta2, the second beta release
	  on the road to 4.2.0.  A lot has happened in the last year:
	    - Partial rewrite and redesign to support multihead setups (with
	      or without Xinerama).
	    - Better support for handling screen size changes via the XRandR
	      extension.
	    - A new autogenerated menu that searches for .desktop files on
	      your filesystem and organises them into hierarchical menus.
	    - Icon support for the applications menu and window list menu
	    - Backdrop color gradient support.
	    - Ability to adjust the brightness of the backdrop image.
	    - Jean-Francois Wauthy wrote a graphical menu editor, which is
	      distributed with xfdesktop.
	    - A panel plugin that can display the menu from xfce4-panel.
	    - An enhanced and partially redesigned settings window, with
	      some global menu settings added.

20031019:
---------

	* Add '-reload', '-menu' and '-windowlist' arguments to xfdesktop to 
	  make it reaload/refresh the image, popup the menu or popup the
	  windowlist repectively.

20031016:
---------

	* Added support for the XRandR X extension available with XFree86
	  4.3 and above. The XRandR support requires you to have Gtk+
	  2.2 or better installed.
