20070121 (Xfce 4.4.0):
----------------------

    We're just about ready to release Xfce 4.4.0!  Hooray!  There have been
    many changes since my last entry.
    
    Change since 4.4rc2:
    
      * Fix support for applications that do pseudo-transparency (bug 2508).
      * Change how icon cell size is calculated to avoid weirdness at large
        sizes (bug 1546).
      * Fix icons disappearing when the icon/text size is set too large, and
        then not reappearing when the size is lowered again (bug 1546).
      * Add hidden options to disable showing any or all of the 'File System',
        'Home', or 'Trash' icons.
      * Partially fix backdrop setting problems when unsetting Xinerama
        stretch mode (bug 2573).
      * Fix some possible (but unliklely) NULL pointer dereferences.
      * Update documentation.
    
    Changes since 4.4rc1:
    
      * Fix crash when non-file:// URIs are dropped on the desktop (bug 2229).
      * Handle Xinerama-enabled setups correctly so icons aren't placed in
        "dead areas" or on the boundary between monitors (bug 1538).
      * Fix crash when reloading the desktop several times quickly (bug 2426).
      * Trash files by default, add binding for shift+delete to force
        deletion (bug 2185).
      * Fix crash when screen size changes (bug 2457).
      * Fix problems with activating icons (bug 2452, 2206).
      * Allow the icons to provide better information about what drag/drop
        actions are allowed, so user feedback about drags/drops is much
        better.
      * Fix broken drop of multiple files onto the desktop (bug 2437).
      * Be sure to notice if a removable volume's mount point changes
        (bug 2489).
      * Fix 100% CPU problem when the desktop folder is deleted (bug 2160).

    Changes since 4.4beta2:
    
      * Fix backdrop image tearing during expose (bug 1944).
      * Show icon tooltips where appropriate (bug 1526).
      * Use thunarx extensions for the icon context menus and properties
        dialogs.
      * Fix ugly gradients in the desktop wallpaper on 16-bit displays
        (bug 1819).
      * Don't show a folder for the desktop directory itself (bug 1916).
      * Fix problems with markup in text labels (bug 2082).
      * Add 'File System', 'Home', and 'Trash' icons.
      * Fix compositing emblems on icons (1875).
      * Use native Pango ellipsising support for the windowlist menu, which
        looks way better (bug 2127).
      * Allow panel plugin's menu to be opened at the pointer position
        (bug 2103).
      * Don't allow cut or delete if the file/dir isn't writeable (buf 2081).
      * Memory leak fixes (bug 1910).
      * Put the icon context menu on the proper screen (bug 2351).
    
    Changes since 4.4beta1:
    
      * Attempt to create ~/Desktop/ if it doesn't exist (bug 1691).
      * Fix non-ejectable media showing as ejectable.
      * Fix removable media not appearing when its mount point has not yet
        been created.
      * Don't have the desktop automatically take focus when it's mapped.
      * Fix crash when removable volume has no mount point (bug 1763).
      * Add support for creating launchers and URL launchers.
      * Allow changing transparency of the icon label text background.
      * Many icon drawing performance improvements, and fixes for some
        drawing glitches.

        plugin (bug 1660).
      * Have the 'log out' dialog pop up if the user 'closes' the desktop
        window (bug 1776).
      * Handle more thunar-vfs errors and prompts.
      * Add XDirectSave support for dropping data on the desktop.
      * Add support for dropping URLs from a browser on the desktop.
      * Fix crash when mounting some removable volumes (bug 1897).

20060418 (Xfce 4.4beta1):
-------------------------

    As usual, it's been a while since I've written anything.  The major new
    accomplishment since my last entry is that all the desktop icon code
    has been refactored, and now, in addition to CDEish minimised application
    icons, xfdesktop supports traditional desktop file icons.  This
    functionality requires very recent versions of libexo and thunar-vfs to
    be present and installed before compiling xfdesktop.
    
    Olivier and Benny just put together the 4.4beta1 release over the weekend,
    so we're (finally!) gearing up to release 4.4.0 final within the next 4-6
    weeks (hopefully).

    Happy Halloween.  I haven't wrote anything here in quite a while.
    Quite a bit has happened, including numerous bugfixes and enhancements.
    I don't have the energy to list them all here, but the one thing that
    really sticks out is that xfdesktop now supports icons on the desktop.
    No, it's not what you think: you can't put launcher icons on it, and
    you can't view lists of files either.  What you *can* do is see icons
    representing all your minimized applications, a la CDE.  Other
    projects (xffm, Thunar) will address the need for file and launcher
    icons.
    
    The Xfce menu panel plugin has seen several improvements, including
    some menu generation speed enhancements, and the ability to put a
    text title in the button, as well as using non-square icons.
    
    On the bugfix front, notably, you can bind 'xfdesktop -menu' and
    'xfdesktop -windowlist' to keys now, and it should work properly all
    the time.
    
    There are a few small enhancements to the backdrop functionality,
    such as the ability to stretch a single image across a Xinerama-
    enabled desktop.
    
    I suppose that's all for now.  Development of Xfce as a whole has been
    moving somewhat slowly lately, so 4.4.0 may not be coming as soon as
    we'd like.

20041220 (Xfce 4.2rc3):
-----------------------

	Xfdesktop is shaping up quite well for the 4.2.0 release, but there
	were a few necessary bugfixes:
	  - Redo the backdrop setting method to fix redraw problems with
	    Gtk 2.6, and to make it a bit nicer to maintain.
	  - Fix a backdrop drawing problem that crops up if you're using
	    multihead and a gtk2 theme with a background pixmap.
	  - The desktop menu cache now tracks changes to the XDG_DATA_DIRS
	    environment variable and invalidates the cache if it changes.
	  - Jean-Francois did some stuff with menueditor, but I think it
	    was just some code reorg and optimisation.
	  - Added back the add/remove workspace items to the windowlist
	    menu because Francois asked oh-so-nicely.

	Hopefully this should be it, and xfdesktop won't need any more changes
	for 4.2.0-final.  Of course, now that I said it, it's ruined.

(Brian)


20041205 (Xfce 4.2rc2):
-----------------------

	Not much has happened with xfdesktop in the last month, mainly some
	minorish bugfixes:
	  - Fix problem with panel plugin where the button can sometimes
	    stay "pressed in" if the menu isn't available.
	  - Documentation updates (Jasper, mostly)
	  - Tweak menu directory searching.
	  - Filter desktop files based on desktop-id to avoid duplicate
	    menu entries.
	  - Fix bug where sticky windows weren't shown in the window list
	    at all.
	  - Fix menu module not loading at all on some systems when the
	    quit() symbol can't be resolved.
	  - Fix problem where window titles with GMarkup in them weren't
	    being escaped properly.
	  - Remove an occurrence of xfce_get_userfile() (replace with
	    xfce_resource_lookup()).
	  - Remove workspace add/remove, as that doesn't work properly
	    anymore, and it probably shouldn't be there anyway.

20041029 (Xfce 4.2beta2):
-------------------------

	* Wow, it's been a while since anyone's put anything in here.  We're
	  gearing up for the release of 4.2beta2, the second beta release
	  on the road to 4.2.0.  A lot has happened in the last year:
	    - Partial rewrite and redesign to support multihead setups (with
	      or without Xinerama).
	    - Better support for handling screen size changes via the XRandR
	      extension.
	    - A new autogenerated menu that searches for .desktop files on
	      your filesystem and organises them into hierarchical menus.
	    - Icon support for the applications menu and window list menu
	    - Backdrop color gradient support.
	    - Ability to adjust the brightness of the backdrop image.
	    - Jean-Francois Wauthy wrote a graphical menu editor, which is
	      distributed with xfdesktop.
	    - A panel plugin that can display the menu from xfce4-panel.
	    - An enhanced and partially redesigned settings window, with
	      some global menu settings added.

20031019:
---------

	* Add '-reload', '-menu' and '-windowlist' arguments to xfdesktop to 
	  make it reaload/refresh the image, popup the menu or popup the
	  windowlist repectively.

(Jasper)


20031016:
---------

	* Added support for the XRandR X extension available with XFree86
	  4.3 and above. The XRandR support requires you to have Gtk+
	  2.2 or better installed.
