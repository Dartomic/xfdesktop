20041205 (Xfce 4.2rc2):
-----------------------

	Not much has happened with xfdesktop in the last month, mainly some
	minorish bugfixes:
	  - Fix problem with panel plugin where the button can sometimes
	    stay "pressed in" if the menu isn't available.
	  - Documentation updates (Jasper, mostly)
	  - Tweak menu directory searching.
	  - Filter desktop files based on desktop-id to avoid duplicate
	    menu entries.
	  - Fix bug where sticky windows weren't shown in the window list
	    at all.
	  - Fix menu module not loading at all on some systems when the
	    quit() symbol can't be resolved.
	  - Fix problem where window titles with GMarkup in them weren't
	    being escaped properly.
	  - Remove an occurrence of xfce_get_userfile() (replace with
	    xfce_resource_lookup()).
	  - Remove workspace add/remove, as that doesn't work properly
	    anymore, and it probably shouldn't be there anyway.

	* Wow, it's been a while since anyone's put anything in here.  We're
	  gearing up for the release of 4.2beta2, the second beta release
	  on the road to 4.2.0.  A lot has happened in the last year:
	    - Partial rewrite and redesign to support multihead setups (with
	      or without Xinerama).
	    - Better support for handling screen size changes via the XRandR
	      extension.
	    - A new autogenerated menu that searches for .desktop files on
	      your filesystem and organises them into hierarchical menus.
	    - Icon support for the applications menu and window list menu
	    - Backdrop color gradient support.
	    - Ability to adjust the brightness of the backdrop image.
	    - Jean-Francois Wauthy wrote a graphical menu editor, which is
	      distributed with xfdesktop.
	    - A panel plugin that can display the menu from xfce4-panel.
	    - An enhanced and partially redesigned settings window, with
	      some global menu settings added.

	* Add '-reload', '-menu' and '-windowlist' arguments to xfdesktop to 
	  make it reaload/refresh the image, popup the menu or popup the
	  windowlist repectively.

20031016:
---------

	* Added support for the XRandR X extension available with XFree86
	  4.3 and above. The XRandR support requires you to have Gtk+
	  2.2 or better installed.
