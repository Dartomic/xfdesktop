	* Wow, it's been a while since anyone's put anything in here.  We're
	  gearing up for the release of 4.2beta2, the second beta release
	  on the road to 4.2.0.  A lot has happened in the last year:
	    - Partial rewrite and redesign to support multihead setups (with
	      or without Xinerama).
	    - Better support for handling screen size changes via the XRandR
	      extension.
	    - A new autogenerated menu that searches for .desktop files on
	      your filesystem and organises them into hierarchical menus.
	    - Icon support for the applications menu and window list menu
	    - Backdrop color gradient support.
	    - Ability to adjust the brightness of the backdrop image.
	    - Jean-Francois Wauthy wrote a graphical menu editor, which is
	      distributed with xfdesktop.
	    - A panel plugin that can display the menu from xfce4-panel.
	    - An enhanced and partially redesigned settings window, with
	      some global menu settings added.

	* Add '-reload', '-menu' and '-windowlist' arguments to xfdesktop to 
	  make it reaload/refresh the image, popup the menu or popup the
	  windowlist repectively.

	* Added support for the XRandR X extension available with XFree86
	  4.3 and above. The XRandR support requires you to have Gtk+
	  2.2 or better installed.
