README for xfdesktop version 4.5
================================

WHAT IS IT?
~~~~~~~~~~~

Xfdesktop is a desktop manager for the Xfce Desktop Environment. Desktop 
in this respect means the root window (or, rather, a window that sits on top
of the root window). The manager handles the following tasks:
- background image / color
- root menu, window list
- minimized app icons
- file icons on the desktop (using Thunar libs)


MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* intltool 0.34
* GTK+ 2.10.0
* libxfce4util 4.5.0svn-r26490
* libxfcegui4 4.5.2svn-r27035
* libwnck 2.12.0
* libxfce4menu 0.1.0svn-r26507 (optional; required for apps menu)
* libthunar-vfs 0.8.0  (optional; required for file icons)
* dbus-glib 0.34  (optional; required for file icons)
* libexo 0.3.2 (optional)


HIDDEN CUSTOMISATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're using the icon view, and would like to change how the text looks,
you have three things you can change: the opacity (transparency) of the
rounded text background, the color of the rounded text background, and the
color of the text itself.

You'd want to add something like this to your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file:

style "xfdesktop-icon-view" {
    XfdesktopIconView::label-alpha = 75

    base[NORMAL] = "#00ff00"
    base[SELECTED] = "#5050ff"
    base[ACTIVE] = "#0000ff"

    fg[NORMAL] = "#ff0000"
    fg[SELECTED] = "#ff0000"
    fg[ACTIVE] = "#ff0000"
}
widget_class "*XfdesktopIconView*" style "xfdesktop-icon-view"

The first entry sets the opacity of the rounded text background.  The allowed
values are from 0 (totally transparent) to 255 (totally opaque).

The second three entries set the color of the rounded text background.
* NORMAL sets the color for the regular, unselected state.
* SELECTED sets the color for when the icon is selected, and the desktop has
  keyboard/mouse focus.
* ACTIVE sets the color for when the icon is selected, but the desktop does
  not have keyboard/mouse focus.

The final three entries set the color of the label text.  See above for the
differences between NORMAL, SELECTED, and ACTIVE.

.:.

You may also want to show or hide the icons in the desktop menu (right-click)
and the window menu (middle-click).  This is controlled by the global gtk
"gtk-menu-images" style property, which can be set by adding something like
the following to your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file:

style "menu-images" {
    gtk-menu-images = false
}
widget_class "*" style "menu-images"

Unfortunately, this will act on all gtk menus, not just on the desktop or
window menu.  There is currently no way to set this property just for these
two menus.
