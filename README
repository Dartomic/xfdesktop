README for xfdesktop version 4.x
================================

WHAT IS IT?
~~~~~~~~~~~
XFDesktop is a desktop manager for the XFce Desktop Environment. Desktop 
in this respect means the root window. The manager handles the following 
tasks:
- background image / color
- virtual desktops: count, names
- root menu

WHAT IS IT NOT?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's not an app to handle icons on the desktop or show minimized app icons.
That is to say, it isn't _yet_. Code contributions that implement this
functionality are of course more than welcome.
