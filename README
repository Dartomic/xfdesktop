README for xfdesktop version 4.4
================================

WHAT IS IT?
~~~~~~~~~~~
Xfdesktop is a desktop manager for the Xfce Desktop Environment. Desktop 
in this respect means the root window. The manager handles the following 
tasks:
- background image / color
- root menu, window list
- minimized app icons
- file icons on the desktop (using Thunar libs)


HIDDEN CUSTOMISATIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're using the icon view, and would like to change how the text looks,
you have three things you can change: the opacity (transparency) of the
rounded text background, the color of the rounded text background, and the
color of the text itself.

You'd want to add something like this to your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file:

style "xfdesktop-icon-view" {
    XfdesktopIconView::label-alpha = 75

    base[NORMAL] = "#00ff00"
    base[SELECTED] = "#5050ff"
    base[ACTIVE] = "#0000ff"

    fg[NORMAL] = "#ff0000"
    fg[SELECTED] = "#ff0000"
    fg[ACTIVE] = "#ff0000"
}
widget_class "*XfdesktopIconView*" style "xfdesktop-icon-view"

The first entry sets the opacity of the rounded text background.  The allowed
values are from 0 (totally transparent) to 255 (totally opaque).

The second three entries set the color of the rounded text background.
* NORMAL sets the color for the regular, unselected state.
* SELECTED sets the color for when the icon is selected, and the desktop has
  keyboard/mouse focus.
* ACTIVE sets the color for when the icon is selected, but the desktop does
  not have keyboard/mouse focus.

The final three entries set the color of the label text.  See above for the
differences between NORMAL, SELECTED, and ACTIVE.

You may also want to show or hide the icons in the desktop menu (right-click)
and the window menu (middle-click).  This is controlled by the global gtk
"gtk-menu-images" style property, which can be set by adding something like
the following to your ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file:

style "menu-images" {
    gtk-menu-images = false
}
widget_class "*" style "menu-images"

Unfortunately, this will act on all gtk menus, not just on the desktop or
window menu.  There is currently no way to set this property just for these
two menus.

.:.

The file icon view by default shows 'special' icons for the root of your
filesystem, your home directory, and the trash.  Removable volumes (such as
USB flash drives) are also shown when they are plugged in.  If you'd like to
configure which of these are shown, edit (or create) the file
~/.config/xfce4/desktop/xfdesktoprc to look something like this:

[file-icons]
show-filesystem=true
show-home=true
show-trash=true
show-removable=true

The defaults are all 'true', but you can set ones you want hidden to 'false'.
If an entry is omitted, it defaults to 'true'.  You will need to restart
xfdesktop to make the settings take effect.
