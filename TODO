for 4.4:
* DnD to/from Thunar to desktop
* fix DnD on top of other icons in file icon mode - move/copy when dropped on
  folder, do nothing otherwise
* nifty rollover/selection effects for the icon rendering like in thunar
* not sure how to make these coexist with the desktop menu:
  - "create folder" menu item
  - "create shortcut" menu option
  - "create document" menu option
  - "arrange items"/"auto arrange" menu option
* rubber banding?  probably not.
