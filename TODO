for 4.4:
* DnD from desktop to Thunar
* prelight icon highlighting
* not sure how to make these coexist with the desktop menu:
  - "create folder" menu item
  - "create shortcut" menu option
  - "create document" menu option
  - "arrange items"/"auto arrange" menu option
* rubber banding?  probably not.
